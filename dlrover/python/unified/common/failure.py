    Description of a failure to achieve elaborate fault tolerance.

    Attributes:
        failure_obj (str): Is workload failure or master failure or trainer

            'WORKLOAD'.
        workload_name (str, optional): The name of the workload(same with
            vertex name and actor name) who got failure. Must be specified if

        workload_role (str, optional): The type of the workload.
        failure_time (int, optional): The timestamp of failure.
        failure_level (int, optional): The severity of the failure:
            -1: not known,
            0: no need to care,
