# Elastic Training Operator For EasyDL
The design described how the elastic operator manages Pods of a EasyDL
training job.

## Motivation
Computing Resources is important for training performance. EasyDL can
automatically configure resources of a job and dynamically adjust
resources of a job during training to optimize training performance.
The operator should be capable of modifying resoures of a job according
to a resource plan, such as scale up/down the number of Pods.

## Design
The `elastic-operator` consists of 2 new CRDs, `ElasticJob` and `JobResource`.
Users use `ElasticJob` to submit an Elastic training job and use `JobResource`
to configure Pods of the job.

### ElasticJob
Users submit an `ElasticJob` to specify the job detail including the trainer's,
parameter server's and worker's image, entrypoint command. Users do not need to
specify any resource information like CPU/memory and replicas of workers 
in `ElasticJob`.  An example of
`ElasticJob` is 

```yaml
apiVersion: "elastic.easydl.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "ElasticJob"
metadata:
  name: "elastic-deepctr-job"
spec:
  command: "python -m model_zoo.iris.dnn_estimator"
  image:
  parameter_server:
    image: elasticdl:iris_estimator 
  worker:
    image: elasticdl:iris_estimator 
  evaluator:
    image: elasticdl:iris_estimator 
```

Firstly, the `elastic-operator` only creates a trainer Pod
and create PS/worker Pods by `JobResource` generated by the trainer.

### JobResource
We can submit a `JobResource` to specify resources of parameter servers and
workers. The `elastic-operator` will receive creation/updation events of
the `JobResource` and create corresponding Pods according resources spec in
the `JobResource`. An example of `JobResource` is 

```yaml
apiVersion: "elastic.easydl.org/v1alpha1"
kind: "JobResource"
metadata:
  name: "elastic-training-resource"
spec:
  selector:
    name: elastic-deepctr-job  // Job Name
  parameter_server:
    replicas: 4
    resource:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4096
      disk: 8192
      gpu: 1
  worker:
    replicas: 4
    resource:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4096
      disk: 8192
      gpu: 1
  evaluator:
    replicas: 1
    resource:
      cpu: 4
      memory: 4096
      disk: 8192
      gpu: 1
  resource_updation:
    - name: "elastic-deepctr-job-ps-0"
      resource:
        cpu: 8
        memory: 8192
    - name: "elastic-deepctr-job-ps-1"
      resource:
        cpu: 16
        memory: 8192
```

After a job starts, we can submit a `JobResource` for the job.
`elastic-operator` will reconcile Pods of the job against this definition.
If the `spec.resource_updation` is not null, `elastic-operator` will
launch a new Pod with the `resource` in `resource_updation` to replace
the Pod with the `resource_updation.name`.

### EasyDL Automatically and Dynamically Configures Resources.

At the submission of a job, `elastic-operator` only launches a Pod for
`ElasticTrainer`. `ElasticTrainer` extracts features from the job and queries
the startup resources from EasyDL `Brain`. Then, `ElasticTrainer` generate and
apply a `JobResource` with the startup resources. `elastic-operator` creates
Pods according to the `JobResource` after watching a creation event of
the `JobResource`. After workers and parameter servers starts, `ElasticTrainer`
will query new sources plans periodically from `Brain` and update the
`JobResource`. `elastic-operator` will adjust resources of workers and
parameter servers according the `JobResource` once it watches a
updation event.
